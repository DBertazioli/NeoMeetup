put this friendly alias in your .bash(rc) config file

>alias cypher='cypher-shell -u <your_username> -p <your_psw> --debug --format verbose' 

deault username is neo4j (as well as default pswd is, but better to change it asap xD)

as always, makin the alias working might require exec

>source ~/.bashrc
